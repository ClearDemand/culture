## Optional Enhancements

If you've had fun with and been able to breeze through the required user stories for the [coding exercise](ops_services_coding_exercise.md), and you want to enhance it further, feel free to tackle the stories below.

_**All the user stories below are completely optional to implement for this exercise**_.

## User Stories - Exports

Rather than producing fancy reports, many times a simple data export will do.  For these stories we simply want to be able to export the data to fulfill the associated use cases.

### General Acceptance Criteria
* As a user, I should be able to export the report so that I can view the underlying report data in Excel

### User Story #4

* Implement an export of data that fulfills the requiremnts outlined in the [Daily Metrics Report requirements from the Software Engineer Coding Exercise](../software_engineer/software_engineer_coding_exercise.md#user-story-4-see-daily-metrics)
* Pay attention to the [general acceptance criteria](./ops_services_coding_exercise.md#general-acceptance-criteria-1) for reports.

### User Story #5
* Implement an export of data that fulfills the requiremnts outlined in the [Summary Report requirements from the Optional Software Engineer Coding Exercise](../software_engineer/software_engineer_coding_exercise_optional.md#user-story-5-view-a-summary-report)
